`https://github.com/parkerlacey/README-generator.git`

You can then use the command `npm` i to download the projects npm dependencies. Currently, that is just Inquirer. Once you have done that you are all set! Now you can run the program with the command node `index.js`.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

After using the `node index.js` command, running the app is simple! You will be given a number of prompts to answer. Once you answer all of the questions the `README.md` file will be created in the `/utils` folder of the project. This process can be seen in the GIF below. From there simply copy the README from the `/utils` directory and paste it in your new project
